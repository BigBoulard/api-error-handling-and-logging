# Assumptions

1 - a `restErr` must be generated straight after an error is detected, from the controller, service, or any other client (db/http)

```go
type restErr struct {
	ErrStatus  int    `json:"status"`
	ErrMessage string `json:"message"`
	ErrError   error  `json:"error"` // raw error
}
```

2 - Logging should only occur in the controller

## Questions

- If logging must only occur in the controller, then I suppose that the log must be generated by using the `restErr` received from the lower levels layers.
  Is-it the correct way to do it?
- How can I keep track of the execution stack in the restErr object to be able to log all the information in the controller like below:
  `Controller > func: Service > func: DB > func: conflict error`?
